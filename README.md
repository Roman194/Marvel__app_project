# Data layer of the Marvell app
## Note
This branch is showing the result of 2nd lab of 2nd term at the "Digital Department" of OmSTU (with IT-firm "Effective" directly involve). <br/>
There are 6 labs in 2nd term. Each one is a part of making the Marvel app. <br/>
## The result
During two weeks the data layer and the ViewModels of the Marvell App have been made. <br/>
## Used features
- Retrofit (to parce the data from the server) <br/>
- MarvelApi (as a server) <br/>
- Moshi (to deserealize JSON response data to the Kotlin object type) <br/>
- Either (to provide response data from data layer to ViewModels) <br/>
- Interceptors (to log possible errors from the server and optimize sending the authorization data to the server). <br/>
